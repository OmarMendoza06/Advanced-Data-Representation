# Description
Advanced data representation functions for Owl Techâ€™s CPU design team.
The program implements functions for converting numbers between different bases and signed number representations using:
oct_to_bin - converts octal to binary
oct_to_hex - converts octal to hexadecimal
hex_to_bin - converts hexadecimal to binary
to_sign_magnitude - represents signed integers in sign-magnitude with 32-bit length output
to_ones_complement - represents signed integers in one's complement with 32-bit length output
to_twos_complement -represents signed integers in two complement with 32-bit length output
